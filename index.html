								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="Founder of Curl Power sitting with curly hair" /></span>
								<p>Our salon was founded by a young woman named Drew, who was searching for her path in life. She had always been drawn to the beauty industry, but it wasn't until she stumbled upon a group of uplifting people with curly hair that she found her true passion.</p>

								<p>Drew was inspired by the confidence and self-acceptance of these individuals, and she knew that she wanted to help others feel the same way. She set off to make her dreams come true, but it wasn't easy at first. Drew faced many challenges as she tried to get her salon off the ground, but she never gave up.</p>
									
								<p>Through hard work and determination, Drew was able to turn her vision into a reality. She surrounded herself with a team of like-minded individuals who shared her vision of empowering people to embrace their authentic beauty.</p>
									
								<p>Today, our salon is a place where people can come to feel confident and comfortable in their own skin. We specialize in curly hair care, and we are dedicated to helping our clients love and embrace their natural curls. Our team is made up of talented and compassionate stylists who are committed to providing the best possible service to our clients.</p>
									
								<p>We believe that everyone has the right to feel beautiful, and we are dedicated to helping our clients achieve the looks that make them feel their best. Whether you are looking for a simple cut or a complete makeover, we are here to help you embrace your authentic beauty and feel confident in your own skin.</p>
